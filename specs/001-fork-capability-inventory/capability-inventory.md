# Fork Capability Inventory (Handy fork)

## Scope

- Settings window
- Onboarding flow
- Recording overlay
- Tray menu
- Platform permission prompts

## Conventions (Phase 2)

- Item id naming: Use lowercase dot-separated ids in the form `<category>.<area>.<item>` (example: `settings.audio_feedback.toggle`).
- Category rules: One of `route`, `component`, `menu`, `settings`, `overlay`, `permission`.
- Decision/rationale rules: `keep` for in-scope features, `hide` for disabled but retained code, `remove` for deletion candidates; default to `keep` if uncertain and note why.
- Missing-data notation: Use `notes` with `missing:commands`, `missing:events`, and/or `missing:settings` when dependency data is unknown.
- Guard point template: id `guard.<area>`; description states scope boundary; covers list contains item ids.

## Cross-Check Notes

- README reviewed for additional user-visible surfaces; no extra UI areas identified beyond current scope.
- External architecture references were not cross-checked because they are not part of the repository.

## JSON Parity Notes

- capabilities.json mirrors the inventory list using normalized item ids derived from the table entries.
